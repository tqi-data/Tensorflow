# Tensorflow

Whatâ€™s TensorFlow?
1. open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs
2. originally developed by Google Brain Team to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research
3. provides an extensive suite of functions and classes that allow users to build various models from scratch

Why TensorFlow?
1. Python API
2. portability: deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API

What is the main difference between TensorFlow and scikit-learn?

TensorFlow is more of a low-level library; basically, we can think of TensorFlow as the Lego bricks (similar to NumPy and SciPy) that we can use to implement machine learning algorithms whereas scikit-learn comes with off-the-shelf algorithms, e.g., algorithms for classification such as SVMs, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and many, many more. TensorFlow really shines if we want to implement deep learning algorithms, since it allows us to take advantage of GPUs for more efficient training.

Other files are from the github repository by Aymeric Damien. These are Tensorflow examples on several machine learning algorithms, including kmeans, linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and random forests.
